Quiz 1


***What I did + Struggles***

    -Made site that changes value of preloaded (as in user does not input their own desired conversions) currency amounts
    -Site usses css animation taken from W3 schools and a button with CSS taken from getcssscan.com
    -Site uses ajax to make api call that then calls an alert to the browser to show what the currency conversion is
    -Couldn't display the converted currency on the table due to time constraint but it would be possible with about 20 more minutes to account for bug fixes
    -Did not have enough time to write fully thoughout paragraphs for the readMe as most of the time was spent trying to figure out how to do the API Calls
    -API calls were a massive struggle to figure out, taking the majority of the time spent on the quiz
    -Site does ***not*** use the "latest.json" file uploaded, it instead fetches it from the host as it wouldn't work locally due to security protocols
