Quiz 1


***What I did + Struggles***

    -Made site that changes value of preloaded (as in user does not input their own desired conversions) currency amounts
    -Site usses css animation taken from W3 schools and a button with CSS taken from getcssscan.com
    -Site uses ajax to make api call that then calls an alert to the browser to show what the currency conversion is
    -Couldn't display the converted currency on the table due to time constraint but it would be possible with about 20 more minutes to account for bug fixes
