# Lab 3: Redesigning the ITWS Website


-***Final Page Build Includes***:
   
    -CSS Accordion that spans out to display information about the Graduatue and Undergraduate Program
   
    -Pretty info cards that display each of the faculty's specific roles on hover and directs users to a contact form (source cited below)
   
    -Pretty news cards (source cited below)
   
    -Icons that link the ITWS Social Media pages
    
    -Contact form (that doesn't send any data)
   

-***Story + Sources***:

-Really struggled with the design phase and didn't get to allocate as much time to that as I would've liked

-Cards were nice, had to modify the css a bit to prevent weird spacing bugs (was unable to fix the card of Prof.Grill unfortunately though, his card overflows a bit)

-News cards were from a different source, but kept with the card theme for the professors providing a nice, uniform look.


-***Issues and Regrets***:
 
-Site is generally unstable in its current form, a single addition or removal could break it entirely

-Site has a loading issue, the icon page at the bottom tends to need to "pop" in rather than loading in with the rest of the site as expected

-Ultimately attempting to string together a large amount of modified css from other soruces was a mistake and in the end:

-***I should've used Bootstrap***

-Bootstrap would've let me have much easier customizability without having to worry about spending time editing pre-existing css to have it function properly with
other parts of the page, Bootstrap would've significantly reduced the amount of time spent working on the project and its bugs.
