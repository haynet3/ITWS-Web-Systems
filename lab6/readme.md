#Lab 6

-***Features***


    -A lightly styled calculator with multiple functions
    -When a second value is not necessary it defaults to 0, otherwise it does a check to ensure that only numbers are passed through
    -Calculator entirely based off PHP code


-***Struggles/Development Story***

     -Initially struggled with getting PHP "accept"/recognize the style.css file provided, was fixed with an Echo statement and help from StackOverflow
     -Couldn't figure out implemnetation of background image to give the site a nicer look-PHP file wouldn't accept it
